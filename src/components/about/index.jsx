                        <p>Hey there, I'm Gio! I am a <a>DevOps Engineer</a> that loves building things and learning new technologies. My tech journey started last August, 2020, just when the pandemic struck the world. I learned how to program, and built all sorts of things, and it was awesome!</p>
                        <br />
                        <p>As of today, I've grown my experience by working in <a>edtech, </a> <a>healthtech, and fintech companies, 2 Y-Combinator Companies</a>, <a> a student-led developer organization, and maybe even for you</a> ðŸ˜‰!</p>
                        <br />
                        <p>I hope to continue making an impact through tech by building and learning!</p>
                        <br />
                        <p>Here are some technologies I've worked with recently:</p>
